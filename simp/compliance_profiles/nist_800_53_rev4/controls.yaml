    title: Access Control Policy And Procedures
    description: "The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organizationdefined\nfrequency]:\na. A formal, documented access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,\nresponsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and\ncompliance; and\nb. Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy\nand associated access controls.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the\neffective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family.\nPolicy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,\npolicies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can\nbe included as part of the general information security policy for organizations. The procedures\ncan be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if\nneeded. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and\nprocedures. Related control: PM-9.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: NIST Special Publications 800-12, 800-100.\n"
    notes: Implementation specific. Though listed in the Technical class, policy and
      procedural controls are established at the organizational level which drives
      technical implementation. SIMP can technically implement this control.
